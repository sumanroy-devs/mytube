 * uploads inside a sixty-day window — so [SubscriptionShortsLoader] runs dry after the recent reels,
 * and with watched reels hidden it runs dry sooner every session. This tier walks the channels
 * themselves instead, and only as far as the user actually swipes: nothing here is fetched to build
 * a queue, only to extend one.
 *
 * Channels are worked a few at a time, each giving two reels per visit, and then parked behind the
 * channels not yet visited — so a page alternates between channels and the next page moves on to
 * new ones instead of draining the same few. A channel's Shorts tab carries no upload dates at all,
 * so real date order is not available here — each tab's own newest-first order, interleaved, is the
 * closest honest approximation.
