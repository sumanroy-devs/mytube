 * Every state transition the player screen makes while a load resolves, as pure functions over

 *
 * The ViewModel keeps the ordering: which side effect runs before which write, and which write is
 * skipped because the load that produced it is no longer current. Nothing here reads the clock, the
 * network, the player or the preferences — the values a transition needs are arguments, so the
 * fields each outcome writes can be asserted without a ViewModel.
